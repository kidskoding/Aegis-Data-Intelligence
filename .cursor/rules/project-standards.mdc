# Project Standards (single source of truth with Claude Code)

These rules are shared with Claude Code. The canonical definitions live in `.github/CLAUDE.md` and `.github/prompts/`. Follow them so both Cursor and Claude Code behave the same.

## Core rules

- **Language:** Use the primary language and version detected in the workspace.
- **Issues:** Use `.github/prompts/ISSUE_PROMPT.md` for all issue creation and task documentation. Read that file when drafting or creating a GitHub issue.
- **Commits:** Use `.github/prompts/COMMIT_PROMPT.md` for all commit message formatting. Read that file when writing or amending commit messages.

## Issue tracking

When asked to draft or create a GitHub issue:

1. **Context check:** Identify the primary programming language and framework of the current project (e.g., Python/FastAPI for backend, React/TS for frontend).
2. **Read:** Load instructions from `.github/prompts/ISSUE_PROMPT.md`.
3. **Implementation:** In the "Proposed Implementation" section, use the **current project's language and best practices** (code snippets or logic suggestions).
4. **Follow:** Use the prefix logic and structure defined in `.github/prompts/ISSUE_PROMPT.md` (e.g. [BUG], [FEAT], [ENH], [REFACTOR], [DOCS], [CHORE]).

## When in doubt

Re-read `.github/CLAUDE.md` for the authoritative project standards.
